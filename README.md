# Imperva Snapshot™ CLI

Imperva Snapshot CLI is a Command Line tool designed to interact with Imperva Snapshot™. 
Imperva Snapshot is a free, fast and easy-to use cloud data security posture assessment service for Amazon RDS managed databases.
Imperva Snapshot will deliver a detailed assessment report to your email with these findings:

- Misconfiguration & Bad Practices - Reviews cloud environment settings and database-specific configurations
- Known Vulnerabilities - Identifies and catalogs database vulnerabilities according to publicly disclosed CVEs
- Privacy & Compliance - Classifies sensitive content that may have a privacy impact
- On-boarding takes seconds, and a report will land in your inbox within 15-20 minutes

Imperva Snapshot can be also installed via [ImpervaSnapshot official page](https://www.imperva.com/resources/free-cyber-security-testing-tools/imperva-snapshot-cloud-data-security-posture/): 

Here we will cover how to install it via CLI.

# CloudFormation
imperva-snapshot-cli works by invoking AWS CloudFormation's Create Stack request on your account.
Behind the scenes, imperva-snapshot-cli collects all the information needs in order to satisfy [ImpervaSnapshot CloudFormation Templates](https://labyrinth-cloudformation.s3.amazonaws.com/impervasnapshot-root-cf.yml).

## CF Parameters
The CloudFormation requires only 3 parameter:
- StackName: The name of the CF stack. This is set to 'ImpervaSnapshot' automatically by the CLI
- AuthenticationToken: This is an autogenerated Token that identify and authenticate users. In case you already have one you can input it via the CLI, otherwise the CLI will automatically generate a new one for you
- DBIdentifier: For Classic RDS, use your DB instance ID. For Aurora, use your DB Cluster ID. You can extract your Identifiers from your [aws account page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/home?#databases)

# How to use it
To initiate an Imperva Snapshot Scan you need to perform 4 simple steps:
1. git clone https://github.com/imperva/imperva-snapshot-cli.git
2. cd imperva-snapshot-cli
3. pip install -r requirements.txt
4. chmod +x installer/main.py
5. python3 ./installer/main.py -i

* You'll need to run `aws configure --profile name_of_your_profile` before you run the CLI

After running the shell script, the interactive CLI will help you fill in the required CF Parameters.

#Interactive vs Inline Mode 
In order to enable all the use-cases this CLI accepts two modes, the Interactive and the Inline mode.

The Interactive Mode run by using the -i parameter “python3 ./installer/main.py -i”. With this mode the CLI will help the user validate the input parameters, listing all available RDS Instances per region & making sure the selected RDS Instance or Aurora Cluster are available in the selected region.

The inline mode expects to get the same set of parameters but in an “inline mode”, for example:

`python3 ./installer/main.py profile=MY-AWS-PROFILE region=THE-LOCATION-OF-THE-RDS database=INSTANCE/CLUSTER-ID email=REPORT-RECIPIENT  accept_eula=OK`

This mode enables the tool to be run periodically or integrated with any CI/CD process or upon creation of new Databases

# AWS Roles
The "roles-templates" folder in this project contains samples of AWS IAM Roles installed in your account. These Roles are automatically removed upon success or failure.

## Running ImpervaSnapshot with Minimal Permissions

To run an ImpervaSnapshot scan, one needs to have a relatively large set of permissions, for example: 
- Create/Delete networking assets
- Restore a DB from a snapshot
- Create/Delete the new restored DB
- Save essential info in customer’s S3 buckets
- more...

In order to follow the “least privilege” principle we managed to explicitly restrict the permissions in the CF template to the minimum needed, for example:
- The tool can delete only the DB we created
- The tool can restore only from the snapshot selected by the user
- The tool can only delete the VPC we have created 
- so forth 

Still, one will need to have the specific lists of roles to run the tool or have Admin permissions.
Sometimes the individual running the tool doesn't have Admin permissions, and the Security team might not be willing to grant the above permissions (although the mentioned restrictions).

### Problem

How can we help Security teams to enable anyone run the tool without needing to grant all permissions needed or Admin privileges?

### Solution
The following is a technical description of the solution including some snippets.

#### Step 1
Security team creates a Role that will enable users to assume it, with the following permissions [let’s call it: impv_snapshot_run_minimum_role]:
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",

                "iam:DeletePolicy",
                "iam:GetPolicyVersion",
                "iam:GetPolicy",
                "iam:GetRolePolicy",
                "iam:GetRole",
                "iam:PutRolePolicy",
                "iam:AttachRolePolicy",
                "iam:DeleteRolePolicy",
                "iam:DetachRolePolicy",
                "iam:PassRole"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:iam::*:role/*labyrinth-root-role",
                "arn:aws:iam::*:role/*labyrinth-sandbox-role",
                "arn:aws:iam::*:role/*labyrinth-setup-role",
                "arn:aws:iam::*:role/*labyrinth-scanner-role",
                "arn:aws:iam::*:role/*labyrinth-reporter-role"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor1",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "lambda:GetFunction",
                "lambda:DeleteFunction",
                "lambda:CreateFunction",
                "lambda:InvokeFunction"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:lambda:*:*:function:*labyrinth-setup-lambda",
                "arn:aws:lambda:*:*:function:*labyrinth-sandbox-lambda"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor3",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:Get*"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::*labyrinth-code*/*",
                "arn:aws:s3:::*labyrinth-code*"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor4",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:CreateVpc",
                "ec2:DescribeVpcs"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor40",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:ModifyVpcAttribute"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor5",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:DeleteVpc"
            ],
            "Resource": "*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "ec2:ResourceTag/Proj": "impervasnapshot"
                }
            }
        },
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor6",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:CreateTags"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:ec2:*:*:*/*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "ec2:ResourceTag/aws:cloudformation:logical-id": "SandboxVpc"

                }
            }
   
    ]
}
```


This set of permissions are the minimal permissions needed in order to make use of Imperva Snapshot specific Roles, Functions, Buckets, VPCs.
As we can see, the roles are restricted to solely effect Imperva Snapshot assets.

This set of permissions will be assumed by the AWS User that requests to run the tool.


In addition, the AWS Role Trust Relationship should be set to `cloudformation.amazonaws.com service`.
This will assure that the AWS Role is assumable only via CloudFormation service.

#### Step 2
The Security team needs to create an AWS Policy that allows the user to:
1. ONLY assume the above role: `impv_snapshot_run_minimum_role`
2. Create and Run a CloudFormation Stack:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "iam:PassRole",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::390467143220:role/impv_snapshot_run_minimum_role"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor1",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "s3:*",
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::*labyrinth-code-staging",
                "arn:aws:s3:::*labyrinth-code"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor4",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "cloudformation:*",
            "Resource": "*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "cloudformation:TemplateUrl": [
                        "https://labyrinth-cloudformation.s3.amazonaws.com/impervasnapshot-root-cf.yml",
                        "https://labyrinth-cloudformation.s3.amazonaws.com/impervasnapshot-setup-cf.yml",
                        "https://labyrinth-cloudformation.s3.amazonaws.com/impervasnapshot-installer-cf.yml",
                        "https://labyrinth-cloudformation-staging.s3.amazonaws.com/impervasnapshot-root-cf.yml",
                        "https://labyrinth-cloudformation-staging.s3.amazonaws.com/impervasnapshot-setup-cf.yml",
                        "https://labyrinth-cloudformation-staging.s3.amazonaws.com/impervasnapshot-installer-cf.yml"
                    ]
                }
            }
        },
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor2",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "cloudformation:List*",
                "cloudformation:Describe*",
                "cloudformation:GetTemplateSummary"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor25",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "cloudformation:DeleteStack",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:cloudformation:*:390467143220:stack/ImpervaSnapshot/*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "iam:ListRoles",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

This policy only allows the user to allow Cloudformation to:
1. Assume `impv_snapshot_run_minimum_role` Role
2. Access to get Imperva Snapshot Code from Imperva's Buckets
3. Be able to run Imperva Snapshot specific CloudFormation Template
4. Delete Imperva Snapshot specific Stack

#### Step 3
Once the user is granted with these permissions, they can instruct CloudFormation to assume the “impv_snapshot_run_minimum_role” Role.

### Recap
There are 3 sets of permissions:
1. The “impv_snapshot_run_minimum_role” AWS Role which contains the restricted permissions needed to run Imperva Snapshot CloudFormation
2. The new policy attached to the user which enables them to instruct CloudFormation to assume the above role
3. The actual restricted Permissions granted to our assets to perform the scan

This way the Security team can create the “impv_snapshot_run_minimum_role” Role once, then each user that requests to run Imperva Snapshot will be granted with the AWS Policy that allows then to run only our template without actually having the permissions themselves 

# Your PDF report is on its way
Once the CF Stack will be successfully created, Imperva Snapshot™ will start to create all the resources required in order to safely scan you RDS.
At the end a PDF report will be generated and sent to your mailbox.
